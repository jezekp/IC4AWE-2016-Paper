    abstract = {{Modular toolkit for Data Processing (MDP) is a data processing framework written in Python. From the user's perspective, MDP is a collection of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and other data processing units that can be combined into data processing sequences and more complex feed-forward network architectures. Computations are performed efficiently in terms of speed and memory requirements. From the scientific developer's perspective, MDP is a modular framework, which can easily be expanded. The implementation of new algorithms is easy and intuitive. The new implemented units are then automatically integrated with the rest of the library. MDP has been written in the context of theoretical research in neuroscience, but it has been designed to be helpful in any context where trainable data processing algorithms are used. Its simplicity on the user's side, the variety of readily available algorithms, and the reusability of the implemented units make it also a useful educational tool.}},

abstract = {Scientists face many severe challenges in extracting value from the increasingly large volumes of data they generate. In this paper we describe the requirements we have derived from working across a wide range of e-science projects. In particular, the CARMEN neuroinformatics project has exposed a range of challenges due to a need to analyse and share large volumes of data. We have identified the four key activities required by scientists with whom we work, and designed an integrated system—e-Science Central—to provide them. This exploits three emerging technologies: software as a service to avoid the need for users to deploy and maintain any of their own software; social networking to allow users to collaborate by sharing data, services and workflows in a controlled manner and Cloud computing to provide scalable compute resources. The system can not only be used through any web browser, but also provides an API so that applications can build on the core functionality. We describe the requirements, and the design that flows from them. This includes data storage with in-built versioning and signing, an in-browser workflow editor and a job scheduling system that allows workflows to be run both on local ‘private’ clouds and the Microsoft Azure Cloud.

    abstract = {{Modular toolkit for Data Processing (MDP) is a data processing framework written in Python. From the user's perspective, MDP is a collection of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and other data processing units that can be combined into data processing sequences and more complex feed-forward network architectures. Computations are performed efficiently in terms of speed and memory requirements. From the scientific developer's perspective, MDP is a modular framework, which can easily be expanded. The implementation of new algorithms is easy and intuitive. The new implemented units are then automatically integrated with the rest of the library. MDP has been written in the context of theoretical research in neuroscience, but it has been designed to be helpful in any context where trainable data processing algorithms are used. Its simplicity on the user's side, the variety of readily available algorithms, and the reusability of the implemented units make it also a useful educational tool.}},

abstract = {Scientists face many severe challenges in extracting value from the increasingly large volumes of data they generate. In this paper we describe the requirements we have derived from working across a wide range of e-science projects. In particular, the CARMEN neuroinformatics project has exposed a range of challenges due to a need to analyse and share large volumes of data. We have identified the four key activities required by scientists with whom we work, and designed an integrated system—e-Science Central—to provide them. This exploits three emerging technologies: software as a service to avoid the need for users to deploy and maintain any of their own software; social networking to allow users to collaborate by sharing data, services and workflows in a controlled manner and Cloud computing to provide scalable compute resources. The system can not only be used through any web browser, but also provides an API so that applications can build on the core functionality. We describe the requirements, and the design that flows from them. This includes data storage with in-built versioning and signing, an in-browser workflow editor and a job scheduling system that allows workflows to be run both on local ‘private’ clouds and the Microsoft Azure Cloud.

abstract ={Tobacco use is increasingly prevalent among vulnerable populations, such as people living in rural Appalachian communities. Owing to limited access to a reliable internet service in such settings, there is no widespread adoption of electronic data capture tools for conducting community-based research. By integrating the REDCap data collection application with a custom synchronization tool, the authors have enabled a workflow in which field research staff located throughout the Ohio Appalachian region can electronically collect and share research data. In addition to allowing the study data to be exchanged in near-real-time among the geographically distributed study staff and centralized study coordinator, the system architecture also ensures that the data are stored securely on encrypted laptops in the field and centrally behind the Ohio State University Medical Center enterprise firewall. The authors believe that this approach can be easily applied to other analogous study designs and settings.},

We have developed Sesame, an architecture for efficient storage and expressive querying of large quantities of metadata in RDF and RDF Schema. Sesame's design and implementation are independent from any specific storage device. Thus, Sesame can be deployed on top of a variety of storage devices, such as relational databases, triple stores, or object-oriented databases, without having to change the query engine or other functional modules. Sesame offers support for concurrency control, independent export of RDF and RDFS information and a query engine for RQL, a query language for RDF that offers native support for RDF Schema semantics. We present an overview of Sesame as a generic architecture, as well as its implementation and our first experiences with this implementation.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract. We present an approach for mapping an OWL ontology into Java. The basic idea is to create a set of Java interfaces and classes from an OWL ontology such that an instance of a Java class represents an instance of a single class of the ontology with most of its properties, classrelationships and restriction-definitions maintained. We note that there exist some fundamental semantic differences between Description Logic (DL) and Object Oriented (OO) systems, primarily related to completeness and satisfiability. We present various ways in which we aim to minimize the impact of such differences, and show how to map a large part of the much richer OWL semantics into Java. Finally, we sketch the HarmonIA framework, which is used for the automatic generation of agent systems from institution specifications, and whose OWL Ontology Creation module was the basis for the tool presented in this paper.}},

   abstract = {The overarching goal of the NIF (Neuroscience Information Framework) project is to be a one-stop-shop for Neuroscience. This paper provides a technical overview of how the system is designed. The technical goal of the first version of the NIF system was to develop an information system that a neuroscientist can use to locate relevant information from a wide variety of information sources by simple keyword queries. Although the user would provide only keywords to retrieve information, the NIF system is designed to treat them as concepts whose meanings are interpreted by the system. Thus, a search for term should find a record containing synonyms of the term. The system is targeted to find information from web pages, publications, databases, web sites built upon databases, XML documents and any other modality in which such information may be published. We have designed a system to achieve this functionality. A central element in the system is an ontology called NIFSTD (for NIF Standard) constructed by amalgamating a number of known and newly developed ontologies. NIFSTD is used by our ontology management module, called OntoQuest to perform ontology-based search over data sources. The NIF architecture currently provides three different mechanisms for searching heterogeneous data sources including relational databases, web sites, XML documents and full text of publications. Version 1.0 of the NIF system is currently in beta test and may be accessed through http://nif.nih.gov .},

ABSTRACT={Progress in experimental tools and design is allowing the acquisition of increasingly large datasets. Storage, manipulation and efficient analyses of such large amounts of data is now a primary issue. We present OpenElectrophy, an electrophysiological data and analysis sharing framework developed to fill this niche. It stores all experiment data and meta-data in a single central MySQL database, and provides a graphic user interface to visualize and explore the data, and a library of functions for user analysis scripting in Python. It implements multiple spike sorting methods, and oscillation detection based on the ridge extraction methods due to Roux et. al., 2007. OpenElectrophy is open-source and is freely available for download at http://neuralensemble.org/trac/OpenElectrophy.}}

ABSTRACT={Recent advances in data monitoring and sensor technology have accelerated the acquisition of very large data sets. Streaming data sets from instrumentation such as multi-channel EEG recording usually must undergo substantial pre-processing and artifact removal. Even when using automated procedures, most scientists engage in laborious manual examination and processing to assure high quality data and to indentify interesting or problematic data segments. Researchers also do not have a convenient method of method of visually assessing the effects of applying any stage in a processing pipeline. EEGVIS is a MATLAB toolbox that allows users to quickly explore multi-channel EEG and other large array-based data sets using multi-scale drill-down techniques. Customizable summary views reveal potentially interesting sections of data, which users can explore further by clicking to examine using detailed viewing components. The viewer and a companion browser are built on our MoBBED framework, which has a library of modular viewing components that can be mixed and matched to best reveal structure. Users can easily create new viewers for their specific data without any programming during the exploration process. These viewers automatically support pan, zoom, resizing of individual components, and cursor exploration. The toolbox can be used directly in MATLAB at any stage in a processing pipeline, as a plug-in for EEGLAB, or as a standalone precompiled application without MATLAB running. EEGVIS and its supporting packages are freely available under the GNU general public license at http://visual.cs.utsa.edu/eegvis.}

ABSTRACT={We deal with collecting experimental data from Electroencephalography (EEG) and Event-Related Potentials (ERP). Lack of tools for experimental data/metadata management has been solved by developing the EEG/ERP Portal. The advantage of the EEG/ERP Portal is its availability from every computer connected to the Internet. Such solution is sufficient for collecting the most of experiments performed in the laboratory.  On the other hand, situations when using a computer is not a viable option are frequent. Many experiments are conducted outside the laboratory with a portable measuring device. In this environment a desktop computer with internet connectivity is usually not available. The other use case is a situation when a researcher discusses the experimental results with colleagues at workshops. A mobile device synchronized with the EEG/ERP Portal seems to be a practical solution. <br /> 	 <br />Facing mentioned needs we have developed a system for collecting experimental data/metadata running on mobile devices. The Android was selected as a mobile operation system because it provides a free SDK with a well-documented API. In addition, the Android is very often used in the current devices. <br />  <br />The system contains a set of forms where a user can fill metadata describing an experiment. The set of metadata is equivalent to metadata that the user can fill in the EEG/ERP Portal. The metadata are described by the internal portal ontology. In addition, the user can upload binary data. The communication of both the mobile EEG/ERP Portal and web EEG/ERP Portal is ensured using RESTfull web services. Server-client architecture is used.  A server part is implemented in the EEG/ERP Portal. The server provides access to the database and sends data to the client implemented inside the mobile device. The communication between the server and client is secured using SSL protocol. User credentials are required; the EEG/ERP Portal user account is used to verify the client. <br />  <br />The application is hosted in GitHub repository: https://github.com/NEUROINFORMATICS-GROUP-FAV-KIV-ZCU/eeg-database-for-android. Users are welcome to download and test it. <br />  <br /> <br />}}

ABSTRACT={Electronic data capture of case report forms (CRFs), demographic, neuropsychiatric, or clinical assessments, can vary from scanning hand-written forms into databases to fully electronic systems.  Web-based forms can be extremely useful for self-assessment; however, in the case of neuropsychiatric assessments, self-assessment is often not an option. The clinician often must be the person either summarizing or making their best judgment about the subject?s response in order to complete an assessment, and having the clinician turn away to type into a web browser may be disruptive to the flow of the interview. The Mind Research Network (MRN) has developed a prototype for a software tool for the real-time acquisition and validation of clinical assessments in remote environments. We have developed the Clinical Assessment and Remote Administration Tablet (CARAT) on a Microsoft Windows PC tablet system, which has been adapted to interact with various data models already in use in several large-scale databases of neuroimaging studies in clinical populations. The tablet has been used successfully to collect and administer clinical assessments in several large-scale studies, so that the correct clinical measures are integrated with the correct imaging and other data. It has proven to be incredibly valuable in confirming that data collection across multiple research groups is performed similarly, quickly, and with accountability for incomplete datasets.  We present the overall architecture and an evaluation of its use. }}

abstract = {Adaptive resonance architectures are neural networks that self-organize stable pattern recognition codes in real-time in response to arbitrary sequences of input patterns. This article introduces ART 2, a class of adaptive resonance architectures which rapidly self-organize pattern recognition categories in response to arbitrary sequences of either analog or binary input patterns. In order to cope with arbitrary sequences of analog input patterns-ART 2 architectures embody solutions to a number of design principles, such as the stability-plasticity tradeoff, the search-direct access tradeoff, and the match-reset tradeoff. In these architectures, top-down learned expectation and matching mechanisms are critical in self-stabilizing the code learning process. A parallel search scheme updates itself adaptively as the learning process unfolds, and realizes a form of real-time hypothesis discovery, testing, learning, and recognition. After learning selfstabilizes, the search process is automatically disengaged. Thereafter input patterns directly access their recognition codes without any search. Thus recognition time for familiar inputs does not increase with the complexity of the learned code. A novel input pattern can directly access a category if it shares invariant properties with the set of familiar exemplars of that category. A parameter called the attentional vigilance parameter determines how fine the categories will be. If vigilance increases (decreases) due to environmental feedback, then the system automatically searches for and learns finer (coarser) recognition categories. Gain control parameters enable the architecture to suppress noise up to a prescribed level. The architecture's global design enables it to learn effectively despite the high degree of nonlinearity of such mechanisms.},

abstract ={Averaged event-related potential (ERP) data recorded from the human scalp reveal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity that is reliably time-locked and phase-locked to experimental events. We report here the application of a method based on information theory that decomposes one or more ERPs recorded at multiple scalp sensors into a sum of components with fixed scalp distributions and sparsely activated, maximally independent time courses. Independent component analysis (ICA) decomposes ERP data into a number of components equal to the number of sensors. The derived components have distinct but not necessarily orthogonal scalp projections. Unlike dipole-fitting methods, the algorithm does not model the locations of their generators in the head. Unlike methods that remove second-order correlations, such as principal component analysis (PCA), ICA also minimizes higher-order dependencies. Applied to detected—and undetected—target ERPs from an auditory vigilance experiment, the algorithm derived ten components that decomposed each of the major response peaks into one or more ICA components with relatively simple scalp distributions. Three of these components were active only when the subject detected the targets, three other components only when the target went undetected, and one in both cases. Three additional components accounted for the steady-state brain response to a 39-Hz background click train. Major features of the decomposition proved robust across sessions and changes in sensor number and placement. This method of ERP analysis can be used to compare responses from multiple stimuli, task conditions, and subject states.},

We study its performance in simulated data as well as in visual and auditory ERPs. For the simulated data, the method gives a significantly better reconstruction of the single-trial event-related responses in comparison with the original data and also in comparison with a reconstruction based on conventional Wiener filtering. Moreover, with wavelet denoising we obtain a significantly better estimation of the amplitudes and latencies of the simulated ERPs. For the real data, the method clearly improves the visualization of both visual and auditory single-trial ERPs. This allows the calculation of better averages as well as the study of systematic or unsystematic variations between trials. Since the method is fast and parameter free, it could complement the conventional analysis of ERPs.}},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Ontology development is a rapidly growing area of research, especially in the life sciences domain. To promote collaboration and interoperability between different projects, the OBO Foundry principles require that these ontologies be open and non-redundant, avoiding duplication of terms through the re-use of existing resources. As current options to do so present various difficulties, a new approach, MIREOT, allows specifying import of single terms. Initial implementations allow for controlled import of selected annotations and certain classes of related terms.FINDINGS:OntoFox http://ontofox.hegroup.org/ is a web-based system that allows users to input terms, fetch selected properties, annotations, and certain classes of related terms from the source ontologies and save the results using the RDF/XML serialization of the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Compared to an initial implementation of MIREOT, OntoFox allows additional and more easily configurable options for selecting and rewriting annotation properties, and for inclusion of all or a computed subset of terms between low and top level terms. Additional methods for including related classes include a SPARQL-based ontology term retrieval algorithm that extracts terms related to a given set of signature terms and an option to extract the hierarchy rooted at a specified ontology term. OntoFox's output can be directly imported into a developer's ontology. OntoFox currently supports term retrieval from a selection of 15 ontologies accessible via SPARQL endpoints and allows users to extend this by specifying additional endpoints. An OntoFox application in the development of the Vaccine Ontology (VO) is demonstrated.CONCLUSIONS:OntoFox provides a timely publicly available service, providing different options for users to collect terms from external ontologies, making them available for reuse by import into client OWL ontologies.}},

ABSTRACT={Metadata providing information about the stimulus, data acquisition, and experimental
conditions are indispensable for the analysis and management of experimental data within
a lab. However, only rarely are metadata available in a structured, comprehensive, and
machine-readable form. This poses a severe problem for ?nding and retrieving data, both
in the laboratory and on the various emerging public data bases. Here, we propose a simple
format, the ?Open metaData Markup Language? (od ML), for collecting and exchanging
metadata in an automated, computer-based fashion. In od ML arbitrary metadata informa-
tion is stored as extended key-value pairs in a hierarchical structure. Central to od ML is
a clear separation of format and content, i.e. neither keys nor values are de?ned by the
format. This makes od ML ?exible enough for storing all available metadata instantly with-
out the necessity to submit new keys to an ontology or controlled terminology. Common
standard keys can be de?ned in od ML terminologies for guaranteeing interoperability. We
started to de?ne such terminologies for neurophysiological data, but aim at a community
driven extension and re?nement of the proposed definitions. By customized terminologies
that map to these standard terminologies, metadata can be named and organized as required
or preferred without softening the standard. Together with the respective libraries provided
for common programming languages, the od ML format can be integrated into the labora-
tory workflow, facilitating automated collection of metadata information where it becomes
available. The flexibility of od ML also encourages a community driven collection and
definition of terms used for annotating data in the neurosciences.}

ABSTRACT={Analysis of existing ontological resources reveals a lack of terms for accurately and unambiguously annotating electrophysiological data and metadata. With the development of different resources for describing and sharing this particular type of data, the community needs controlled vocabularies to describe the different types of electrophysiology recording paradigms.      <br />     <br />To build such vocabulary, or ontology, we created a dedicated workgroup involving relevant initiatives such as the EEGBase (http://eegdatabase.kiv.zcu.cz/home.html), the G-Node (www.g-node.org), the INCF task force on standards for sharing of electrophysiology data (http://www.incf.org/programs/datasharing/electrophysiology-task-force), NIF (www.neuinfo.org) and Neuroelectro.org (www.neurolectro.org).     <br />      <br />As the field of electrophysiology is heterogeneous and multifaceted and the corresponding scope of the ontology considerable, the development of OEN has been separated along two main branches: a branch considering devices and methods, and a branch considering neurophysiological concepts. Here, we describe the first version of the Ontology for Experimental Neurophysiology ( OEN, https://github.com/G-Node/OEN), focused on devices and methodology, and our strategy for the creation of the neurophysiological concepts.     <br />     <br />The device branch terminology is built upon existing ontologies related to neurophysiological experiments or investigation, namely the Ontology for Biomedical Investigation (OBI, http://obi-ontology.org/) and the Neural ElectroMagnetic Ontologies,  (NEMO, http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/NEMO). Existing terms describing neurophysiological devices and methods have been imported using the MIREOT format (Courtot et al., 2011) and the web service Ontofox (http://ontofox.hegroup.org/). The granularity of the ontology has been extended using the odML terminology (http://www.g-node.org/projects/odml/terminologies) and terms from the EEGBase.      <br />To test our ontology, we created a simple knowledge base to describe the content of the EEGBase database. We are showing here some preliminary results and the infrastructure to transform EEGBase into semantic EEGBase.      <br />     <br />In parallel we are developing a terminology to describe neurophysiological concepts such as action potential. This work is done in collaboration with other relevant ontologies such as the Phenotypic Quality Ontology (PATO,  http://obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/PATO:Main_Page) and the Gene Ontology,  (GO, http://www.geneontology.org). To gather the feedback of the community, we are using Neurolex and web-based surveys to gather and assess the diversity of definitions.}}

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Compared to the waveform or spectrum analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs), time-frequency representation (TFR) has the advantage of revealing the ERPs time and frequency domain information simultaneously. As the human brain could be modeled as a complicated nonlinear system, it is interesting from the view of psychological knowledge to study the performance of the nonlinear and linear time-frequency representation methods for ERP research. In this study Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT) and Morlet wavelet transformation (MWT) were performed on mismatch negativity (MMN) of children. Participants were 102 children aged 8-16 years. MMN was elicited in a passive oddball paradigm with duration deviants. The stimuli consisted of an uninterrupted sound including two alternating 100 ms tones (600 and 800 Hz) with infrequent 50 ms or 30 ms 600 Hz deviant tones. In theory larger deviant should elicit larger MMN. This theoretical expectation is used as a criterion to test two TFR methods in this study. For statistical analysis MMN support to absence ratio (SAR) could be utilized to qualify TFR of MMN.RESULTS:Compared to MWT, the TFR of MMN with HHT was much sharper, sparser, and clearer. Statistically, SAR showed significant difference between the MMNs elicited by two deviants with HHT but not with MWT, and the larger deviant elicited MMN with larger SAR.CONCLUSION:Support to absence ratio of Hilbert-Huang Transformation on mismatch negativity meets the theoretical expectations, i.e., the more deviant stimulus elicits larger MMN. However, Morlet wavelet transformation does not reveal that. Thus, HHT seems more appropriate in analyzing event-related potentials in the time-frequency domain. HHT appears to evaluate ERPs more accurately and provide theoretically valid information of the brain responses.},

The implementation of new algorithms is easy and intuitive. The new implemented units are then automatically integrated with the rest of the library. MDP has been written in the context of theoretical research in neuroscience, but it has been designed to be helpful in any context where trainable data processing algorithms are used. Its simplicity on the user's side, the variety of readily available algorithms, and the reusability of the implemented units make it also a useful educational tool.}},

abstract = {Scientists face many severe challenges in extracting value from the increasingly large volumes of data they generate. In this paper we describe the requirements we have derived from working across a wide range of e-science projects. In particular, the CARMEN neuroinformatics project has exposed a range of challenges due to a need to analyse and share large volumes of data. We have identified the four key activities required by scientists with whom we work, and designed an integrated system—e-Science Central—to provide them. This exploits three emerging technologies: software as a service to avoid the need for users to deploy and maintain any of their own software; social networking to allow users to collaborate by sharing data, services and workflows in a controlled manner and Cloud computing to provide scalable compute resources. The system can not only be used through any web browser, but also provides an API so that applications can build on the core functionality. We describe the requirements, and the design that flows from them. This includes data storage with in-built versioning and signing, an in-browser workflow editor and a job scheduling system that allows workflows to be run both on local ‘private’ clouds and the Microsoft Azure Cloud.

  abstract = {This book emphasizes the power of basic Web technologies -- the HTTP application protocol, the URI naming standard, and the XML markup language; introduces the Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA), a common-sense set of rules for designing RESTful web services; Shows how a RESTful design is simpler, more versatile, and more scalable than a design based on Remote Procedure Calls (RPC); and includes real-world examples of RESTful web services, like Amazon's Simple Storage Service and the Atom Publishing Protocol; discusses web service clients for popular programming languages. It also shows you how to implement RESTful services in three popular frameworks - Ruby on Rails, Restlet (for Java), and Django (for Python), and focuses on practical issues such as: how to design and implement RESTful web services and clients. This is the first book that applies the REST design philosophy to real web services. It sets down the best practices you need to make your design a success, and the techniques you need to turn your design into working code. You can harness the power of the Web for programmable applications: you just have to work with the Web instead of against it.},
